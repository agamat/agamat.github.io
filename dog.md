breeds comprise outcrossings 


hybridization across t clades
identical-bydescent ibd haplotype sharing

haplotypes were phased in
 100-snp windows=
 a minimum haplotype size of 232 kb


shared haplotypes length summed f each pair 

median shared haplotype lengths:
1) 9 742 000 bp

- all 161 dog breeds, 
- 3 varieties, 
- 3 country of origin populations 
- 2 wild canids

ribbons connecting breeds = a median 
haplotype sharing : all dogs of each breed 
- over 95% 
of
haplotype sharing : across clades


line connecting 2different breeds:
- breeds have very similar genetic backgrounds
- over 95% of their shared genetic material (haplotypes) is the same as the genetic material shared among all the dogs within each breed
