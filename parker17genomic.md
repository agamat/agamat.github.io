breeds comprise outcrossings 

"Haplotypes" :
- small chunks of DNA, inherited together
- puzzle pieces made of genes that tend to stick together and are passed down from generation to generation.

small genetic segments (haplotypes): pieces of DNA that are relatively short in length. Despite their small size, they can still carry important genetic information and can be shared among different dog breeds, indicating common ancestry or recent crossbreeding events.

these breeds were likely created by selectively breeding from an original group of dogs

rather than through mixing 
with other breeds in recent times

low level of genetic sharing between diverse breeds

y: the amount of shared genetic material (median total haplotype)

- the more recent the mixing of breeds
- the higher the percentage of shared genetic material between them

the newer the breed created from crossbreeding, the more shared genetic material it tends to have with its parent breeds


t multi-breed clades formed through
- recent admixture 
- common ancestral sources?

migration in 18 groups 
of
- 4 / more breeds:


- 16 clades (tree)
- 2 groups 
of
 small clades :
- american terrier/american toy ^
- small spitz/toy spitz/schnauzer


Treemix : 

- 0–12 predicted migration events (movement of genes between different breed groups)
- calculating t increase in
 maximum likelihood score 
 over a zero migration tree
- admixture effect
on
 clade formation
- assess the impact of migration or gene flow between different groups (clades) of dog breeds.



- "maximum likelihood score": how well a particular model (tree) fits the observed data
 - higher scores indicating a better fit.

comparing the maximum likelihood score of a tree that
- allows for migration events 
- no migration (a "zero migration tree"), 

they determined the increase in the maximum likelihood score


This increase = how much better the model fits the data when migration between breed groups is taken into account
- the impact of gene flow on the formation of these breed groups



the creation of modern dog breeds and the sharing of diseases among them.

2/18 groups of breeds, = clades: significant mixing between different breeds: 
- New World breeds 
- Asian toy breeds.

modern dog breeds : 
- selecting for specific traits within an ancient breed type. 
- occasionally, unrelated breeds might have been mixed in to enhance these traits.

diseases being shared across different clades:
- collie eye anomaly (CEA) affects the eyes of several herding breeds such as collies, UK Rural clade:
- Border collies, 
- Shetland sheepdogs, 
- Australian shepherds
- disease from a common ancestor shared by all affected breeds, the genetic patterns inherited the disease-causing mutation from this common ancestor



surprising discoveries about the origins of certain diseases in dog breeds and the unexpected connections between breeds:

- Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever:  breed, developed in Canada, unexpectedly shares a disease called collie eye anomaly (CEA) with certain herding breeds like collies and Shetland sheepdogs. 
- Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever's origins were unclear
- collies or Shetland sheepdogs likely contributed to the formation of this breed, explaining the presence of the CEA mutation.

- German Shepherd Dogs and MDR1 Mutation: 
- Many UK herding breeds have a mutation in the MDR1 gene, : affects their response to certain medications
- 10% of German Shepherd Dogs also have this mutation
- link between German Shepherds and UK Rural breeds through the Australian Shepherd, indicating the unexpected role of Australian Shepherds in the development of German Shepherds.

- Chinook Breed and MDR1 Mutation: 
- 15% frequency
- recent mixing between Chinooks and German Shepherds
- mixing with Collies, both carriers of the MDR1 mutation
- Chinook breed also carry the mutation- not confirmed yet



 genetic analyses help understand the relationships between different dog breeds and how they've evolved over time:

Phylogenetic Analyses Limitations: 

- Traditional tree-like structures used in genetic analyses can't fully explain how dog breeds developed because they overlook crossbreeding events. 
- Single mutations can create distinct traits shared across breeds from different groups, suggesting that mixing between breeds is a significant source of diversity.

- Haplotype Sharing: while most breeds have unique genetic signatures in large regions, they often share small genetic segments (haplotypes) with other breeds
- recent crossbreeding events are common and contribute to breed diversity.




Crossbreeding: 
- breeds: the Pug and Chinook, have extensive genetic sharing with breeds from different groups, indicating their involvement in crossbreeding
- Pug likely originated in Asia and contributed to the development of many small breeds. The Chinook, a more recent breed, has multiple ancestors from different breeds, reflecting its complex history.

- Challenges of Phylogeny: limitations of relying solely on phylogenetic trees to understand breed relationships.
 - Crossbreeding events complicate the picture
 - as new hybrid breeds are introduced, the tree structure may need to be revised.

    Historical Insights: Genetic analyses can also provide insights into historical events. For example, by estimating the time of crossbreeding events, researchers can refine our understanding of how certain breeds were created. This helps us interpret historical records, such as accounts of dog fighting in Ireland during the 1860s, which coincide with the creation of bull and terrier crosses.
